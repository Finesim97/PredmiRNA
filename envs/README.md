This directory contains [enviroment files](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html#create-environment-file-by-hand) for anaconda, a package manager.

The use of a package manager allows us to forgo the manual installation of program libraries/dependencies and the enviroment approach prevents version conflicts. 

The enviroments will be installed in ~/.snakemake/conda/(hashcode of the envfile)
